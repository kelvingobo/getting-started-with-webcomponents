# Getting Started with Webcomponents

This repo is the source code to my quick introduction to web components. It is a simple custom element that I have created called <lazy-image> that fades an image in only when it is fully loaded.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kelvingobo/getting-started-with-webcomponents.git
```
## Usage

```
<lazy-image src="/path-to-image"></lazy-image>
```
